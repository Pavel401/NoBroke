App Brief: "What If I Invested?"
Tagline: Turn everyday choices into what-ifs that grow.

1. Purpose & Vision
"What If I Invested?" is a simple, interactive app designed to make teens think differently about money.
By turning everyday spending choices into potential investment scenarios, it helps young users connect short-term spending with long-term growth - encouraging curiosity, awareness, and saving habits early on.

2. Core Concept
Teens often spend without realizing the opportunity cost of small daily purchases.
This app lets them visualize - instantly - what that same amount could be worth today if they had invested it instead.
Example:
You were about to spend $12 on pizza 🍕.
What if you had invested it in NVIDIA (NVDA) one year ago?
Result: $12 → $21.60 (+80%)
Past performance is not an indicator of future results.

3. Key Features
a. No Login Needed
* Instant access - open and use.
* Keeps it lightweight and safe for minors.
* Optional "Save My Session" or "Share Result" toggle (local only, no accounts).
b. Item Database (100+ Teen Purchases)
* Search or scroll through everyday items: pizza, sneakers, bubble tea, hoodies, AirPods, video games, etc.
* Each item has a typical price, but users can edit it.
* Categories: Food, Fashion, Tech, Entertainment, School, Lifestyle.
c. Investment Comparison Engine
* Choose from 15 investment options:
Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, Walmart, Costco, Nike, LLY (Eli Lilly), McDonald's, Apple, Tesla, SPY, VOO, QQQ, and Bitcoin (optional).
* Calculates 1-year growth using the past year's actual performance data (fetched via API or cached weekly).
* Displays:
o Amount today vs. if invested 1 year ago
o % return
o Simple bar or growth chart
d. Educational Nudges
Each result screen ends with:
* "💡 Past performance is not an indicator of future results."
* A fun fact or tip (e.g., "Teens who invest early benefit from compounding power.")
* Optional "Learn More" link: Basics of saving, investing, and compound growth (simple illustrated pages).

4. User Flow
1. Open App → Welcome screen

2. Search or browse item → Select one (e.g., Sneakers)
3. Enter or confirm price → "I'm spending $120."
4. Choose investment → Select a company or ETF (e.g., Nike)
5. Results screen →

o "You'd have $158.40 today (+32%)."
o Message: Past performance is not an indicator of future results.

5. Visual & UX Style
* Minimalist, Gen-Z-friendly design:
bold typography, pastel gradients, emoji icons, smooth transitions.
* Tone: Conversational, encouraging, slightly witty.
* Color palette: Mint green + navy (growth & trust).
* Optional gamified streaks: "You've rethought 10 purchases this week!"

6. Data Source
* Use a reliable market data API such as Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance to pull 1-year historical returns for selected companies and ETFs.
* Data should refresh automatically on a weekly or monthly schedule.

7. Developer Collaboration Requirement
* The developer will not only build the app but also mentor a 9th-grade student through the process.
* This includes:
o Explaining the overall app architecture and logic flow.
o Demonstrating how the item database and investment calculator work.
o Walking through one example end-to-end: from item selection → data fetch → return calculation → result screen.
o Encouraging hands-on participation in testing and minor updates (e.g., adding a new item or editing labels).
* Goal: Help the student understand how real-world finance and app logic connect - bridging coding with financial literacy.
